# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project aims to create a robust movie recommendation system utilizing machine learning techniques. The system recommends movies to users based on their past interactions and preferences. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, similarity measures, and the implementation of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding the data through various visualizations and statistical methods.
- **Similarity Measures:** Calculating similarities between users and items using metrics like cosine similarity.
- **Model Implementation:** 
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Making recommendations based on user-item interactions.
  - **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommending items based on the content similarity.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes budget, genres, homepage, id, keywords, original_language, original_title	overview, popularity, production_companies, production_countries, release_date, revenue, runtime, spoken_languages, status, tagline, title, vote_average, and vote_count for various movies. It is preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies and to normalize the data for better performance.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook `Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb` to explore the implementation. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.
